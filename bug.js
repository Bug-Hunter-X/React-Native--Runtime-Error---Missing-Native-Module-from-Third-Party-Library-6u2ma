This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly linked to your React Native project.  It usually manifests as a runtime error during execution, and may not be caught during compilation. The exact error message might vary slightly depending on the specific library and how it is integrated.

```javascript
// Example scenario: Using a library 'react-native-uncommon-library'
import UncommonLibrary from 'react-native-uncommon-library';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <UncommonLibrary />
    </View>
  );
};
```

The problem is that the `react-native-uncommon-library` isn't correctly linked, possibly due to an issue during installation, or mismatch between native and JS code.
