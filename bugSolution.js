The solution involves ensuring the third-party library is correctly linked.  Here are a few approaches:

**1. Using `react-native link` (If applicable):**
Many libraries support `react-native link`. After installation, run this command in your terminal from the project root.

```bash
react-native link react-native-uncommon-library
```

**2. Manual Linking (More complex, library specific):**
If `react-native link` fails, you'll likely need to manually link the library. This requires editing the native project files (Android's `android/app/build.gradle` and iOS's `ios/{YourAppName}.xcodeproj`). Consult the library's documentation for specifics on how to do this.

**3. Cleaning and Rebuilding:**
Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild solves the issue.

```bash
npm run clean && npm install && react-native run-android  // Or react-native run-ios
```

**4. Verify the dependency in `package.json`:**
Make sure the library is correctly listed under dependencies in your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-uncommon-library": "^",
    // ... other dependencies
  }
}
```

**5. Updating React Native:**
An outdated React Native version might have compatibility issues. Update to the latest stable version.

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
expo upgrade
```

After trying these steps, rebuild and run your app. The error should be resolved.
