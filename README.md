# React Native: Runtime Error - Missing Native Module from Third-Party Library

This repository demonstrates a common but often tricky React Native error: a runtime failure due to an incorrectly linked or missing native module from a third-party library.

The `bug.js` file shows how the issue might present itself.  The solution (`bugSolution.js`) illustrates various ways to address the problem.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install the necessary packages: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the app (the error will occur).

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file contains solutions. These are common troubleshooting steps for this kind of error.

**Possible solutions:**
* **Verify library installation:** Double-check the installation instructions for the library.  Sometimes extra linking steps are required (e.g., using `react-native link`).
* **Check native code:** If the library has native modules, make sure these are correctly compiled and linked to your project.  Look at platform-specific instructions.
* **Clean and rebuild:** Try running `npm run clean` (or the equivalent for your build system) and rebuilding the project.
* **Examine error messages closely:** The exact error message often gives clues to the missing module.  Search the internet for the specific error message.
* **Check package.json:** Verify if the third-party library is correctly listed as a dependency in your `package.json` file.
* **Update react-native:** An outdated react-native version can sometimes cause linking issues.
* **Verify Podfile (iOS) or build.gradle (Android):**  Ensure that the necessary native dependencies are correctly added and configured in the appropriate platform files. This usually involves manual addition if `react-native link` fails.

This example aims to help developers understand how to diagnose and troubleshoot such errors.
